//better way of defining a class
class User {
    readonly city: string = ""
    constructor(
        public email: string,
        public name: string,
        private userId: string
    ) {
        this.email = email;
        this.name = name;
        this.userId = userId;
    }
}


Getter and Setter

    get courseCount(): number {
        return this._courseCount;
    }

    set courseCount(courseNum) {
        if (courseNum <= 1) {
            throw new Error("Course count should be more than 1")
        }
        this._courseCount = courseNum;
    }

setter cannot have a return type at all. Not even void or never

Can have private methods too

private deleteToken() {
    return "Token deleted"
}
