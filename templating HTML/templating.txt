349. Configuring Express For EJS

create a new folder
initiate the node
install express
install ejs
create a new file index.js


create a general app

app.set to set the view engine to ejs
app.set('view engine', 'ejs')


all static files will be in the  folder named views
and the extension will be .ejs

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('home')
})


350. Setting The Views Directory

const path = require('path');
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, '/views'));

__dirname is the current directory from where the code is being called
and we are joining the views folder to it
