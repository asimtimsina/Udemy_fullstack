428. Using Morgan - Logger Middleware

morgan('tiny') -> gets info about the request and logs it to the console

app.use(morgan('tiny')); 



429. Defining Our Own Middleware

app.use() -> takes a function as an argument
we can define our own middleware function
must have the req, res, and next arguments in that order
next() -> must be called at the end of the function to move on to the next middleware function
