330. Working With module.exports

const math = require('./math');
need ./ to tell node that it is a file and not a package

module.exports -> exoports the function or variable to the outside world
exports -> is a shortcut to module.exports

331. Requiring A Directory

if we require a directory, node will look for index.js file in that directory
all the files in that directory will be available in the index.js file
Just need to call the directory name and not the file name

const allCats = require('./shelter')
console.log(allCats)
