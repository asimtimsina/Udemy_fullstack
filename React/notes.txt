595. The Basics of JSX

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript.
It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript. 
JSX gets compiled to React.createElement() calls which return plain JavaScript objects called “React elements”. Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.

It allows us to write markup that looks like HTML directly inside of our HTML.
It's not legal JS on it's own so it must be transpiled into JS.

Babel behind the scenes will take the JSX and convert it into React.createElement() calls.
