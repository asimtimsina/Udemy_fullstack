        TLD .np Nepal (English: /nɪˈpɔːl/;[16] Nepali: नेपाल [nepal]), formerly the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal
        (Nepali: सङ्घीय लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्र नेपाल),[17] is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly situated
        in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, bordering Tibet of China to the north, and
        India in the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and
        from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine
        forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on
        Earth. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the
        official language. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city. The name "Nepal" is first recorded in
        texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the
        predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of
        Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of
        Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat
        of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was
        dominated by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture.
        By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the
        Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The
        country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary
        democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese
        Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the
        world's last Hindu monarchy. The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a secular
        federal parliamentary republic divided into seven provinces. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955,
        and friendship treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat
        of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. Nepal is also
        a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative. The Nepalese Armed Forces are the
        fifth-largest in South Asia; and are notable for their Gurkha history, particularly during the world wars, and
        has been a significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had
        earlier evolved.[29][30][31] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years
        ago.[32] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same
        time.[33] After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent
        structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now
        Balochistan.[34] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley civilisation,[35][34] the first urban culture
        in South Asia.[36] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in
        the Siwalik hills of Dang district.[37] The earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal and adjoining areas are
        believed to be people from the Indus Valley civilisation. It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history
        predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the
        arrival of other ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border.[38] By 4000 BC,
        the Tibeto-Burmese people had reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and
        north-east India or both.[39] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and
        Dravidians, who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the
        valley of Kathmandu.[40]</p>

    <h3>Medieval Nepal</h3>
    <p>In the 11th century, a powerful empire of Khas people emerged in western Nepal whose territory at its highest
        peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and Uttarakhand of India. By the 14th
        century, the empire had splintered into loosely associated Baise rajyas, literally 22 states as they were
        counted. The rich culture and language of the Khas people spread throughout Nepal and as far as Indo-China in
        the intervening centuries; their language, later renamed the Nepali language, became the lingua franca of Nepal
        as well as much of North-east India.[45]
