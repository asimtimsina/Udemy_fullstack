        <h1>Pangolin </h1>

        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (from Ancient Greek
            φολῐ́ς,
            "horny scale"). The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis
            comprises
            the four species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in
            Sub-Saharan
            Africa. These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species
            are
            also known.
        </p>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with
            this
            feature. They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their
            diet
            consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long tongues. They tend to be solitary
            animals, meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two
            years.
        </p>

        <h2>Poaching</h2>
        <p>
            Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are used in Chinese traditional
            medicine)
            and heavy deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the world.As of
            January 2020, of the eight species of pangolin, three (Manis culionensis, M. pentadactyla and M. javanica)
            are
            listed as critically endangered, three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) are
            listed as endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla and Smutsia temminckii) are listed as vulnerable on
            the
            Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

    <section> The <section> HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it.

            <h2>Nepal</h2>
            <p>Nepal (English: /nɪˈpɔːl/;[16] Nepali: नेपाल [nepal]), formerly the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal
                (Nepali: सङ्घीय लोकतान्त्रिक गणतन्त्र नेपाल),[17] is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly
                situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, bordering Tibet of China
                to the north, and India in the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by
                the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography,
                including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains,
                including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual,
                multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language. Kathmandu is the
                nation's capital and the largest city.</p>
        </article>
        <aside>In the 11th century, a powerful empire of Khas people emerged in western Nepal whose territory at its
            highest peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and Uttarakhand of India. By
            the 14th century, the empire had splintered into loosely associated Baise rajyas, literally 22 states as
            they were counted. The rich culture and language of the Khas people spread throughout Nepal and as far as
            Indo-China in the intervening centuries; their language, later renamed the Nepali language, became the
            lingua franca of Nepal as well as much of North-east India.[45]
