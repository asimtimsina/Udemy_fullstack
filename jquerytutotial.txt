1. Getting Started with jQuery

$(selector).action()

$(document).ready(function(){} 

Put every jQuery command in document ready function so that it will be executed only after the DOM is fully loaded.


   $("button").click(function () {
        $("h1").hide();
    })

2. jQuery Events

$(function(){
    $("p").click(function(){
        console.log("A paragraph was clicked.");
    })
})

dblclick
mouseenter
mouseleave
mousedown
mouseup
hover -> takes two functions as arguments, first is for mouseenter and second is for mouseleave

form events
focus
blur
change
select

remove a event handler
$("p").off("click");

running event only once
$("div").one("click", function () { });
