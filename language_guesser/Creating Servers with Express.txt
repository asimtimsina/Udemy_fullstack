340. Introducing Express

Difference between Library and Framework

Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.
A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how “opinionated” it is.


Express 
Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.


341. Our Very First Express App

https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html

npm init -y -> creates package.json file with default values // starting point of our app
npm i express -> Install Express


index.js
const express = require('express');

const app = express()
console.log(app)

app.listen() -> starts a UNIX socket and listens for connections on the given path. This method is identical to Node’s http.Server.listen().
app.use() -> Mounts the specified middleware function or functions at the specified path: the middleware function is executed when the base of the requested path matches path.
